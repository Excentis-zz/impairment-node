Rigorously testing a network device or distributed service requires complex,
realistic network test environments. Linux Traffic Control (tc) with Network
Emulation (netem) provides the building blocks to create an impairment node that
simulates such networks.

This products was our quick-and-dirty implementation of a layer 2 impairment
node with Linux Traffic Control. We've been using it since to test our traffic
generator/analyzer 'ByteBlower' in impaired circumstances and to demonstrate
to our customers how it operates within non-ideal network conditions.
